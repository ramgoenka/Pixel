# Pixel (CURRENTLY DOWN)
üê± **Pixel** is a Discord bot written in Python and contains a bunch of random (perhaps useful?) commands. Functionality includes but is not limited to: greetings, sending cat images, asking trivia questions, playing games such as trivia, rock paper scissors, performing basic and advanced mathematical computations, setting countdowns and reminders, balancing chemical reactions, and much more, all of which make Pixel a fun-to-use Discord bot.
