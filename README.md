# Pixel 
🐱 **Pixel** is a Discord bot written in Python and contains a bunch of random (perhaps useful?) commands. Functionality includes but is not limited to: greetings, sending cat images, asking trivia questions, playing games such as trivia, rock paper scissors, performing basic and advanced mathematical computations, setting countdowns and reminders, balancing chemical reactions, and much more, all of which make Pixel a fun-to-use Discord bot.

⚠️ **NOTE**: All code is in the ``MainCode.py`` file and the ``keepalive.py``. The ``main.py`` file contains the code and logic behind all of the commands the bot has and the ``keepalive.py`` file is used to enable the bot to stay online and running 24/7.

⚠️ **Please** use the command `p;help` in Discord to learn more about the various commands the bot has as well as how to use it.
